- CTF stands for capture the flag. In cybersecurity, a CTF is a fun way to learn hacking skills, in a practical and legal way in a more controlled and protected environment.
- In the middle of May 2022 I started the CTF challenges and won over 200+ rooms and got my position in the top 1% worldwide and worldwide [Top 5]() in the month of July.
