- What I have learned from this internship
- CTF, OWASP Top 10, PenTesting (Nmap, Burp Suite, Hydra), Android Security (Android Malware Analysis, Unix Backdoors), Network Security, Information Security, Threat Intelligence, OSINT, Cloud Security, MITRE ATT&CK, Splunk.
- But what I liked the most was that I started to develop a cybersecurity mindset, which would help me with Web Dev, Cloud Security, IoT, Embedded Systems, just about anything as security is a crucial part of any technology.
