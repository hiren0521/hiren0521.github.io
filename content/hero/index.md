I'm an Security Researcher and Bug Bounty Hunter at Bugcrowd & Intigriti. Currently working as a Software QA Analyst at [Invints Infotech LLP](https://www.invints.com/).

Outside work, I occasionally write blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/) to give back to community. Off-screen i enjoy some Science experiment and solo traveling.
