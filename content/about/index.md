Hello! Interestingly, As a child, I remember being fascinated by the world of internet and participate in CTF geek challenges.
And I was introduced to hacking and penetration testing in my freshman year at [Sigma Institute of Engineering,](https://sigma.ac.in)
Where I did my Bachelor's in Information Technology (2016-2020).

Currently, I am focused as a QA Analyst at [Invints Infotech LLP](https://invints.com). 
I worked with web applications, web penetration tests, UI/UX tests. It has tested over 50+ websites from a variety of industries, including 
e-commerce, banking, management, gaming, commerce, government, and financial services. I also write blogs on [Medium](https://medium.com/@imhiren).

Here is a list of the skils that I'm familiar with!
