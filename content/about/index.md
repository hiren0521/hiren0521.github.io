Hello! Interestingly, As a child, I remember being fascinated by the world of internet and playing geeky CTF challenges, and I got introduced to Software Testing and Hacking in my freshman year at [Sigma Institute of Engineering,  Vadodara](https://sigma.ac.in/), Where i pursued my bachelor's in Information Technology (2016-2020).

I'm currently working as a Software Quality Assurance Analyst in the [Invints Infotech LLP](https://invints.com/).

Here is a list of the skils that I'm familiar with!
